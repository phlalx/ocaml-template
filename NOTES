# Jbuiler/merlin integration

There are some issues with merlin and jbuilder .merlin generated files

https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/issues/761

A fix is to:
 * remove the ppx_* (except for *runtime-libs/expanders) from the .merlin file,
 * remove ppx from jbuilder libraries list, only necessary for the pps field.
